# Deep Learning License Plate Recognition
Use Google’s TensorFlow framework to create a Deep Learning model for object recognition in pre-recorded videos and live
camera feed.  We’re hoping to achieve 95%+ accuracy in detecting License Plates and be able to read them with the same 
amount of certainty.
